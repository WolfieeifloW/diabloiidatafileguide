# Diablo II Data File Guide

https://wolfieeiflow.github.io/diabloiidatafileguide/

Sick of your retinas burning looking at the Diablo II Data File Guide provided by Blizzard?  
Annoyed with the Table of Contents being stuck at the top so you have to scroll all the way back up to click to a different section?

Look no further!  
My edited version of the D2DFG is dark moded for easy viewing.  
It has a sidebar with all the txt files for easy searching / jumping around.  
And it runs smoother than the default Blizzard one!

If you enjoy my version of the D2DFG and want to support me you can donate to me!
