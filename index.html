                    <br>
                    <p>This file is loaded together with other similar files in the
                        following order: weapons.txt, armor.txt, misc.txt</p>
                    <p>These combined files form the items structure. Technically
                        these files share the same fields, but some fields are exclusive for specific
                        item types, so they are not displayed in the data files that do not need them.</p>

                        will be saved.</p>
                    <p><b>rarity -</b> Determines the chance that the item will randomly spawn (1/#). The higher the
                        value then the rarer
                        the item will be. This field depends on the "spawnable" field being enabled, the "quest"
                        field being disabled, and
                        the item level being less than or equal to the area level. This value is also affected by
                        the relative Act number
                        that the item is dropping in, where the higher the Act number, then the more common the item

                    <p><b>speed -</b> If the item type is an armor, then this will affect the Walk/Run Speed
                        reduction when wearing the
                        armor. If the item type is a weapon, then this will affect the Attack Speed reduction when

                    <p><b>nodurability -</b> Boolean Field. If equals 1, then the item will not have durability. If
                        equals 0, then the item
                        will have durability.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b>level -</b> Controls the base item level. This is used for determining when the item is
                        allowed to drop, such as
                        making sure that the item level is not greater than the monster's level or the area level.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>ShowLevel -</b> Boolean Field. If equals 1, then display the item level next to the item
                        name. If equals 0, then
                        ignore this.</p>

                        affected by item

                        identifier to reference the
                        item.</p>
                    <p><b>namestr -</b> String Key that is used for the base item name</p>

                        Field. If equals 1 and the "quest" field is enabled, then the game will check
                        the current difficulty setting and will tie that difficulty setting to the
                        quest item. This means that the player can have more than 1 of the same quest
                        item as long each they are obtained per difficulty mode (Normal / Nightmare /
                        Hell). If equals 0 and the "quest" field is enabled, then the player can only
                        have 1 count of the quest item in the inventory, regardless of difficulty.</p>

                        current Strength attribute value to modify the bonus damage percent from the
                        equipped item. If this equals 1, then default the value to 100.</p>
                    <p><b>DexBonus -</b> The percentage multiplier that gets multiplied the player's
                        current Dexterity attribute value to modify the bonus damage percent from the
                        equipped item. If this equals 1, then default the value to 100.</p>
                    <br>

                        based on the "gemapplytype" field. For example, if this value equals 9, then
                        the game will start with index 9 ("Chipped Emerald") and ignore the previously
                        defined gems in the gems.txt file, which can mean that those ignored gems will
                        not apply modifiers when socketed into the item.</p>
                    <p><b>bitfield1 -</b> Controls different flags that can affect the item. Uses an
                        integer value to check against different bit fields by using the "&"
                        operator. For example, if the value equals 5 (binary = 101) then that returns
                        true for both the 4 (binary = 100) and 1 (binary = 1) bit field values.</p>

                    <p>This file controls what item affixes (groups of item
                        modifiers) are automatically applied to items, regardless of their quality
                        type. These item affixes will not change the quality of the item.</p>
                    <p>An example can be class based items like a paladin shield
                        that can be Normal Quality but still have Paladin skill bonuses without
                        changing the item's name.</p>

                        If equals 0, then this item affix is never used.</p>
                    <p><b>rare -</b> Boolean Field. If equals 1, then this item affix can be
                        used when randomly assigning item modifiers when a rare item spawns. If equals

                    <p><b>classlevelreq -</b>
                        The minimum character level required for a specific class in order to equip an item
                        that has this item affix. This relies on the class specified in the "class"
                        field. If equals null, then the class will default to using the "levelreq"
                        field.</p>

                    <p><b>frequency -</b> Controls the probability that the affix appears on the item
                        (a higher value means that the item affix will appear on the item more often).
                        This value gets summed together with other "frequency" values from all possible
                        item affixes that can spawn on the item, and then is used as a denominator
                        value for the randomizer. Whichever item affix is randomly selected will be the
                        one to appear on the item. The formula is calculated as the following: [Item
                        Affix Selected] = ["frequency"] / [Total Frequency]. If the item has a magic
                        level (from the "magic lvl" field in weapons.txt/armor.txt/misc.txt) then the
                        magic level value is multiplied with this value. If equals 0, then this item
                        affix will never appear on an item.</p>

                        cannot spawn with more than 1 item affix with the same group number. This is
                        used to guarantee that certain item affixes do not overlap on the same item. If
                        this field is null, then the group number will default to group 0.</p>

                    <p>Item Quality is determined by first calculating the roll
                        chance for a specific Quality. Then the game will attempt a random roll for
                        that Item Quality. If that roll fails, then the game will calculate for the
                        next lower Item Quality.</p>
                    <p>The order of Item Quality calculations is the following:
                        Unique &gt; Set &gt; Rare &gt; Magic &gt; High Quality (Superior) &gt; Normal
                        &gt; Low Quality</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The following information details how the game uses the Data
                        Fields in its calculations.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b><u>Step 1: Calculate the Base Probability</u></b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The first part of the calculations is to obtain the base
                        probability for rolling the item quality with the following formula:</p>
                    <p><b>Probability = ( Quality - ( mlvl - ilvl ) / Divisor ) *
                            128</b></p>

                    <br>

                    <p>This probability value is a ratio divisor, meaning that
                        there is a 1 in probability chance of the game choosing that Item Quality, so
                        the lower the probability value, then the better the chance the item will
                        successfully roll that Item Quality. The multiplication with 128 is for
                        decreasing rounding errors. The <b>Quality</b> value is the
                        "Unique"/"Set"/"Rare"/"Magic"/"HiQuality"/"Normal" Data Field. The <b>mlvl</b>
                        value is the Monster Level, which depends on the current area level and game
                        difficulty (this can also be the level for the chest drop). The <b>ilvl</b>
                        value is the Base Item Level (See the "level" field in the
                        weapons.txt/armor.txt/misc.txt or the "lvl" field in
                        UniqueItems.txt/SetItems.txt). The <b>Divisor</b> value is the
                        "UniqueDivisor"/"SetDivisor"/"RareDivisor"/"MagicDivisor"/"HiQualityDivisor"/"NormalDivisor"
                        Data Field.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b><u>Step 2: Calculate Magic Find</u></b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The game will then obtain the character's magic find bonus
                        from items. If the current calculation is for Unique/Set/ Rare Quality items and
                        the magic find item bonus exceeds 110%, then the character's magic find will be
                        modified with diminishing returns:</p>
                    <p><b>MagicFind = 100 + MF * dim / (MF + dim)</b></p>

                    <br>

                    <p>The <b>MF </b>value is the character's magic find bonus
                        percentage value plus the baseline default 100 value (See "item_magicbonus" in
                        ItemStatCost.txt). The <b>dim</b> value is a special modifier for adding
                        diminishing returns to the magic find bonus, which differs based on the Item
                        Quality being calculated (Unique = 250, Set = 500, Rare = 600)</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>After calculating the proper magic find value, the
                        probability value is modified with the following formula:</p>
                    <p><b>Probability = Probability * 100 / MagicFind</b></p>

                    <br>

                    <p>This will reduce the Probability value, giving the Item
                        Quality a higher chance to be successfully rolled.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b><u>Step 3: Calculate Probability with Treasure Class</u></b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>After calculating the baseline probability with the magic
                        find bonus, the game will then compare this value with the minimum value for
                        the Item Quality to cap it from reducing any further (See
                        "UniqueMin"/"SetMin"/"RareMin"/"MagicMin" Data Fields). High Quality (Superior)
                        and Normal Quality do not have a minimum value.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The game will then modify the probability with the value
                        from the related Treasure Class:</p>
                    <p><b>Probability = Probability - Probability * TreasureClass /
                            1024)</b></p>

                    <br>

                    <p>The <b>TreasureClass</b> value is a modifier for this Item
                        Quality based on the Treasure Class being used (See the
                        "Unique"/"Set"/"Rare"/"Magic" field from the TreasureClassEx.txt file)</p>

                    <br>

                    <p><b><u>Step 4: Roll for the Item Quality</u></b></p>

                    <br>

                    <p>Finally, after calculating the overall value of the
                        probability for the Item Quality, the game will then find a random number
                        between 0 and the probability value. If that random value is between 0 and 128,
                        then the item has successfully rolled that specific Item Quality. Otherwise,
                        the calculations will move on to checking for the next lower Item Quality.</p>

                        "maxstat" field to ensure that it never exceeds that value. If equals 0, then
                        ignore this, and the stat will simply update in these cases. This only applies
                        to skills that use skill server function 65, 66, 81, and 82.</p>

                        the unit. This is typically used for weapons and is important when dual
                        wielding weapons so that when a unit attacks, then one weapon's stats do not
                        stack with another weapon's stats.</p>

                        which theme number to use in a Level Substitution (See LvlSub.txt). The allowed
                        values are 0 to 4, which convey which "Prob#", "Trials#", and "Max#" field to
                        use from the LvlSub.txt file. If this equals -1, then there is no sub theme for
                        the area level.</p>

                    <p><b>SubWaypoint -</b> Controls the level substitutions for adding waypoints in
                        the area level (see LvlSub.txt). This uses a defined sub type to choose from (See
                        "SubType"). This will depend on the room having a waypoint tile.</p>
                    <p><b>SubShrine -</b> Controls the level substitutions for adding shrines in the
                        area level (see LvlSub.txt). This uses a defined sub type to choose from (See
                        "SubType"). This will depend on the room allowing for a shrine to spawn.</p>

                    <p><b>Vis0

                        visibility of other area levels involved with this area level, allowing for
                        travel functionalities between levels. This uses the "Id" field of another
                        defined area level to link with this area level. If this equals 0, then no area
                        level is specified.</p>

                    <p><b>Warp0
                            (to Warp7) -</b> Uses the "Id" field
                        from LevelWarp.txt</b><b>, </b>which defines which Level Warp to use when exiting the area
                        level. This is connected with the definition of the related "Vis#" field. If
                        this equals -1, then no Level Warp is specified which should also mean that the
                        related "Vis#" field is not defined.</p>

                    <br>

                    <p><b>Intensity -</b> Controls the
                        intensity value of the area level's ambient colors. This affects brightness of
                        the room's RGB colors. Uses a value between 0 and 128. If all these related
                        fields equal 0, then the game ignores setting the area level's ambient colors.</p>

                    <p><b>Red -</b> Controls the red
                        value of the area level's ambient colors. Uses a value between 0 and 255.</p>

                    <p><b>Green
                            -</b> Controls the green
                        value of the area level's ambient colors. Uses a value between 0 and 255.</p>

                    <p><b>Blue
                            -</b> Controls the blue

                    <p><b>Portal
                            -</b> Boolean Field. If
                        equals 1, then this area level will be flagged as a portal level, which is saved
                        in the player's information and can be used for keeping track of the player's
                        portal functionalities. If equals 0, then ignore this.</p>

                    <p><b>Position
                            -</b> Boolean Field. If
                        equals 1, then enable special casing for positioning the player on the area
                        level. This can mean that the player could spawn on a different location on the
                        area level, depending on the level room's position type. An example can be when
                        the player spawns in a town when loading the game, or using a waypoint, or
                        using a town portal. If equals 0, then ignore this.</p>

                    <p><b>SaveMonsters
                            -</b> Boolean Field. If
                        equals 1, then the game will save the monsters in the area level, such as when all
                        players leave the area level. If equals 0, then monsters will not be saved and
                        will be removed. This is usually disabled for areas where monsters do not
                        spawn.</p>

                        level. This is used for
                        specific quests handling lists of monsters in the area level.</p>

                        Level Preset,
                        which are used for determining how big to build area levels. These values are
                        equal to 0 for Level Presets that are static.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b>AutoMap -</b> Boolean Field. If equals 1, then this Level Preset will be
                        automatically completely revealed on the Automap. If equals 0, then this Level Preset
                        will be hidden on the Automap and will need to be explored.</p>
                    <p><b>Scan -</b> Boolean Field. If equals 1, then this Level Preset will
                        allow the usage of warping with waypoints (This requires that the Level Preset
                        has a waypoint object). If equals 0, then ignore this.</p>

                    <br>

                    <p><b>Pops -</b> Defines how many Pop tiles are defined in the Level Preset
                        file. These Pop tiles are mainly used for controlling the roof and wall popping
                        when a player enters a building in an area.</p>
                    <p><b>PopPad -</b> Determines the size of the Pop tile area, by using an
                        offset value. This offset value can increase or decrease the size of the Pop
                        tile size if it has a positive or negative value.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b>Files -</b> Determines the number of different versions to use for the
                        Level Preset. This value acts as a range, which the game will use for randomly
                        choosing one of the "File#" fields to build the Level Preset. This is how the
                        Level Presets have variety when the area level is being built.</p>
                    <p><b>File1 (to File6) -</b> Specifies the name of which ds1 file to use. The ds1 files
                        contain data for building Level Presets. If this value equals 0, then this
                        field will be ignored. The number of these defined fields should match the
                        value used in the "Files" field.</p>
                    <p><b>Dt1Mask -</b> This functions as a bit field mask with a size of a 32 bit
                        value. This explains to the ds1 file which of the 32 dt1 tile files to use from
                        a Level Type when assembling the Level Preset. Each "File#" field from
                        LevelType.txt is assigned a bit value, up to the 32 possible bit values. (For
                        example: File1 = 1, File2=2, File3 = 4, File4=8, File5=16….File32 =
                        2147483648). To build the "Dt1Mask", you would select which "File#" fields to
                        use from LevelTypes.txt and add their associated bit values together for a
                        total value. This total value is the bitmask value.</p>

                        Frequency]. If the item has a magic level (from the "magic lvl" field in
                        weapons.txt/armor.txt/misc.txt) then the magic level value is multiplied with

                        the item, and then is used as a denominator value for the randomizer. Whichever

                        formula is calculated as the following: [Item Affix Selected] = ["frequency"] /
                        [Total Frequency]. If the item has a magic level (from the "magic lvl" field in
                        weapons.txt/armor.txt/misc.txt) then the magic level value is multiplied with

                        affix with the same group number. This is used to guarantee that certain item
                        affixes do not overlap on the same item. If this field is null, then the group
                        number will default to group 0.</p>

                    <p><b>CollideKill -</b> Boolean Field. If equals 1, then the missile will be
                        destroyed when it collides with something. If equals 0, then the missile will
                        not be destroyed when it collides with something.</p>

                    <p><b>CollideFriend
                            -</b> Boolean Field. If equals 1, then the missile can collide with friendly units,
                        including the caster. If equals 0, then the missile will ignore friendly units.</p>
                    <p><b>LastCollide
                            -</b> Boolean
                        Field. If equals 1, then the missile will track the last unit that it collided
                        with, which is useful for making sure the missile does not hit the same unit
                        twice. If equals 0, then ignore this.</p>
                    <p><b>Collision
                            -</b> Boolean
                        Field. If equals 1, then the missile will have a missile type path placement
                        collision mask when it is initialized or moved. If equals 0, then the missile
                        will have no placement collision mask when it is created or moved.</p>
                    <p><b>ClientCol
                            -</b> Boolean
                        Field. If equals 1, then the missile will check collision on the client,
                        depending on the missile's "CollideType" field. If equals 0, then ignore this.</p>
                    <p><b>ClientSend
                            -</b> Boolean
                        Field. If equals 1, then the server will create the missile on the client. This
                        can be used when reloading area levels or transitioning units between areas. If
                        equals 0, then ignore this.</p>
                    <p><b>NextHit
                            -</b> Boolean
                        Field. If equals 1, then the missile will use the next delay. If equals 0, then
                        ignore this.</p>
                    <p><b>NextDelay
                            -</b> Controls
                        the delay in frame length until the missile is allowed to hit the same unit
                        again. This field relies on the "NextHit" field being enabled.</p>

                    <p><b>xoffset
                            & yoffset & zoffset -</b> Specifies the X, Y,
                        and Z location coordinates (measured in pixels) to offset to visually draw the
                        missile based on its actual location. This will only offset the visual graphics
                        of the missile, not the missile itself. The Z axis controls the visual height
                        of the missile.</p>
                    <p><b>Size
                            -</b> Defines
                        the diameter in sub-tiles (for both the X and Y axis) that the missile will
                        occupy. This affects how the missile will collide with something or how the
                        game will handle placement for the missile.</p>

                            -</b> Boolean
                        Field. If equals 1, then the missile will be destroyed if the caster unit is located
                        in an act town. If equals 0, then ignore this.</p>
                    <p><b>CltSrcTown
                            -</b> If this
                        value is greater than 0 and the "LoopAnim" field is disabled, then this field
                        will control which frame to set the missile's animation when the player is in
                        town. This value gets subtracted from the "AnimLen" value to determine the
                        frame to set the missile's animation. </p>
                    <p><b>CanDestroy
                            -</b> Boolean
                        Field. If equals 1, then the missile can be attacked and destroyed. If equals
                        0, then the missile cannot be attacked.</p>

                    <p><b>ToHit
                            -</b> Boolean
                        Field. If equals 1, then this missile will use the caster's Attack Rating stat
                        to determine if the missile should hit its target. If equals 0, then the
                        missile will always hit its target.</p>
                    <p><b>AlwaysExplode
                            -</b> Boolean
                        Field. If equals 1, then the missile will always process an explosion when it
                        is killed, which can use a server hit function (See "pSrvHitFunc") and can use the
                        "HitSound" and "ExplosionMissile"
                        fields on the client side. If equals 0, then the missile will only rely on
                        proper collision hits to process an explosion.</p>
                    <p><b>Explosion
                            -</b> Boolean
                        Field. If equals 1, then the missile will be classified as an explosion which
                        will make it use different handlers for finding nearby units and dealing
                        damage. If equals 0, then ignore this.</p>

                    <br>

                    <p><b>Town
                            -</b> Boolean
                        Field. If equals 1, then the missile is allowed to be alive when in a town
                        area. If equals 0, then the missile will be immediately destroyed when located
                        within a town area.</p>
                    <p><b>NoUniqueMod
                            -</b> Boolean
                        Field. If equals 1, then the missile will not receive bonuses from Unique
                        monster modifiers. If equals 0, then the missile will receive bonuses from
                        Unique monster modifiers.</p>
                    <p><b>NoMultiShot
                            -</b> Boolean
                        Field. If equals 1, then the missile will not be affected by the Multi-Shot
                        monster modifier. If equals 0, then the missile will be affected by the
                        Multi-Shot monster modifier.</p>

                    <p><b>Holy -</b> Controls a bit field flag where

                    <p>This file controls the functionalities for miscellaneous
                        type items, such as the non-weapons and non-armor items.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>This file is loaded together with other similar files in the
                        following order: weapons.txt, armor.txt, misc.txt</p>
                    <p>These combined files form the items structure. Technically
                        these files share the same fields, but some fields are exclusive for specific
                        item types, so they are not displayed in the data files that do not need them.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Any column field name starting with "*" is considered a
                        comment field and is not used by the game</p>

                    <h3 id="miscdf"><b>Data Fields</b></h3>

                    <p><b>compactsave -</b> Boolean Field. If equals 1, then only the item's base stats will be
                        stored in the character save, but not any modifiers or additional stats. If equals 0, then
                        all of the items stats will be saved.</p>
                    <p><b>rarity -</b> Determines the chance that the item will randomly spawn
                        (1/#). The higher the value then the rarer the item will be. This field depends
                        on the "spawnable" field being enabled, the "quest" field being disabled, and
                        the item level being less than or equal to the area level. This value is also
                        affected by the relative Act number that the item is dropping in, where the
                        higher the Act number, then the more common the item will drop.</p>

                    <p><b>spawnable -</b> Boolean Field. If
                        equals 1, then this item can be randomly spawned. If equals 0, then this item
                        will never randomly spawn.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b>speed -</b> If the item type is an armor, then this will affect the Walk/Run

                    <p><b>durability -</b> Defines the base durability amount that the item will spawn
                        with.</p>
                    <p><b>nodurability -</b> Boolean Field. If equals 1, then the item will not have
                        durability. If equals 0, then the item will have durability.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b>level -</b> Controls the base item level. This is used for determining
                        when the item is allowed to drop, such as making sure that the item level is
                        not greater than the monster's level or the area level.</p>
                    <p><b>ShowLevel -</b> Boolean Field. If equals 1, then display the item level
                        next to the item name. If equals 0, then ignore this.</p>
                    <p><b>levelreq -</b> Controls the player level requirement for being able to use

                        "group" value from the automagic.txt file, instead of using random prefixes.

                        the "quest" field is enabled, then the game will check the current difficulty
                        setting and will tie that difficulty setting to the quest item. This means that
                        the player can have more than 1 of the same quest item as long each they are
                        obtained per difficulty mode (Normal / Nightmare / Hell). If equals 0 and the
                        "quest" field is enabled, then the player can only have 1 count of the quest
                        item in the inventory, regardless of difficulty.</p>

                    <br>

                        determines what type of missile is used when using the throwing weapons</p>
                    <p><b>durwarning -</b> Controls the threshold value for durability to display the
                        low durability warning UI. This is only used if the item has durability.</p>
                    <p><b>qntwarning -</b> Controls the threshold value for quantity to display the
                        low quantity warning UI. This is only used if the item has stacks.</p>
                    <br>

                    <br>
                    <p><b>StrBonus -</b> The percentage multiplier that gets multiplied the player's
                        current Strength attribute value to modify the bonus damage percent from the
                        equipped item. If this equals 1, then default the value to 100.</p>
                    <p><b>DexBonus -</b> The percentage multiplier that gets multiplied the player's
                        current Dexterity attribute value to modify the bonus damage percent from the
                        equipped item. If this equals 1, then default the value to 100.</p>

                    <p><b>gemoffset -</b> Determines the starting index offset for reading the
                        gems.txt file when determining what effects gems or runes will have the item
                        based on the "gemapplytype" field. For example, if this value equals 9, then
                        the game will start with index 9 ("Chipped Emerald") and ignore the previously
                        defined gems in the gems.txt file, which can mean that those ignored gems will
                        not apply modifiers when socketed into the item.</p>
                    <p><b>bitfield1 -</b> Controls different flags that can affect the item. Uses an integer
                        value to check against different bit fields by using the "&" operator. For
                        example, if the value equals 5 (binary = 101) then that returns true for both
                        the 4 (binary = 100) and 1 (binary = 1) bit field values.</p>

                    <p>This
                        file controls how a monster may be created with specific type of inventory
                        equipment items</p>

                    <p>These
                        equipment items are randomly generated on the monster, based on the specified
                        parameters in this file</p>

                    <p>This
                        data relies on the "inventory" field being enabled for the listed monster,
                        found in the monstats.txt file</p>

                    <p><b>monster
                            -</b> Defines the monster
                        that should be equipped. Points to the matching "Id" value in the monstats.txt
                        file. If the monster has multiple defined equipment possibilities, then they
                        should always be grouped together. The game will go through the list in order
                        to match what is best to use for the monster.</p>

                    <p><b>oninit -</b> Defines if the
                        monster equipment is added on initialization during the monster's creation,
                        depending how the monster is spawned. Monsters created by a skill have this
                        value set to 0. Monsters created by a level have this value set to 1.</p>

                    <p><b>level -</b> Defines the level
                        requirement for the monster in order to gain this equipment. The game will
                        prefer the highest level allowed, so the order of these equipment should be
                        from highest level to lowest level.</p>

                    <p><b>loc1 (to loc3) -</b> Specifies
                        the inventory slot where the item will be equipped. Once an item is equipped on
                        that body location, then the game will skip any duplicate calls to equipping
                        the same body location. This is another reason why the equipment should be
                        ordered from highest level to lowest level.</p>

                        spawned, like a monster pack. The "minion1" field is also used for spawning a
                        monster when this monster is killed while it has the "SplEndDeath" field
                        enabled.</p>

                    <p><b>BossXfer -</b> Boolean Field. If equals 1, then the monster's AI will
                        transfer its boss recognition to another monster, which can affect the minion
                        monster behaviors after this boss is killed. If equals 0, then ignore no boss
                        AI will transfer and minion monsters will behave differently after the boss is
                        killed. This field relies on the "SetBoss" field being enabled.</p>
                    <p><b>PartyMin -</b> The minimum number of minions that can spawn with this
                        monster. Uses the "minion1" and "minion2" fields. The actual number is a random
                        value chosen between the "PartyMin" and "PartyMax" field values.</p>
                    <p><b>PartyMax -</b> The maximum number of minions that can spawn with this
                        monster. Uses the "minion1" and "minion2" fields. The actual number is a random
                        value chosen between the "PartyMin" and "PartyMax" field values.</p>
                    <p><b>MinGrp -</b> The minimum number of duplicates of this monster that can
                        spawn together. The actual number is a random value chosen between the "MinGrp"
                        and "MaxGrp" field values.</p>
                    <p><b>MaxGrp -</b> The maximum number of duplicates of this monster that can

                        and "MaxGrp" field values.</p>
                    <p><b>sparsePopulate -</b> If this value is greater than 0, then it controls the
                        percent chance that this monster does not spawn, and another monster will spawn
                        in its place. (Out of 100)</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b>Velocity -</b> Determines the movement velocity of the monster, which can
                        be the monster's baseline walk speed.</p>
                    <p><b>Run -</b> Determines the run speed of the monster as opposed to walk
                        speed. This is only used if the monster has a Run mode.</p>
                    <p><b>Rarity -</b> Modifies the chance that
                        this monster will be chosen to spawn in the area level. The higher the value
                        is, then the more likely this monster will be chosen. This value acts as a
                        numerator and a denominator. All "Rarity" values of possible monsters get
                        summed together to give a total denominator, used for the random roll. For
                        example, if there are 3 possible monsters that can spawn, and their "Rarity"
                        values are 1, 2, 2, then their chances to be chosen are 1/5, 2/5, and 2/5
                        respectively. If this value equals 0, then this monster is never randomly
                        selected to spawn in an area level.</p>
                    <p><b>Level -</b> Determines the monster's level. This value for Nightmare

                        second purpose is to select a code which affects what attack animation the

                        monster's actual mode but only what mode that sounds think the monster is
                        using. (See MonMode.txt for the list of possible inputs)</p>

                    <h3 id="objectsdf">Data Fields</h3>

                    <p><b>Class -</b> Defines the unique type class of the object which is used
                        to reference this object. These are also defined in the objpreset.txt file.</p>
                    <p><b>Name -</b> String key. Used
                        as the display name of the object when being highlighted by the player.</p>
                    <p><b>Token -</b> Determines what files to use to display the graphics of the
                        object. These are defined by the ObjType.txt file.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b>Selectable0 (to Selectable7) -</b> Boolean Field. If equals 1, then the object can be
                        selected
                        by the player and highlighted when hovered on by the mouse cursor. If equals 0,
                        then the object cannot be selected and will not highlight when the player
                        hovers the mouse over it. Each field is numbered, correlating to 1 of 8 Object
                        Modes that the object uses (See Overview section, or ObjMode.txt).</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b>SizeX & SizeY -</b> Controls the amount of sub tiles that the object occupies
                        using X and Y coordinates. This is generally used for measuring the object's
                        size when trying to spawn objects in rooms and controlling their distances
                        apart.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b>FrameCnt0 (To FrameCnt7) -</b> Controls the frame length of the object's mode. If this
                        equals 0, then that mode will be skipped. Each field is numbered, correlating
                        to 1 of 8 Object Modes that the object uses (See Overview section, or
                        ObjMode.txt).</p>
                    <p><b>FrameDelta0 (to FrameDelta7) -</b> Controls the animation frame rate of how many frames to
                        update per delta (Measured in 256ths). Each field is numbered, correlating to 1
                        of 8 Object Modes that the object uses (See Overview section, or ObjMode.txt).</p>
                    <p><b>CycleAnim0 (to CycleAnim7) -</b> Boolean Field. If equals 1, then the object's current
                        animation will loop back to play again when it finishes. If equals 0, then the
                        object will generally play the Opened mode after playing the Operating mode.
                        Each field is numbered, correlating to 1 of 8 Object Modes that the object uses
                        (See Overview section, or ObjMode.txt).</p>
                    <p><b>Lit0 (to Lit7) -</b> Controls the Light Radius distance value for the object. If
                        this value equals 0, then the object will not emit a Light Radius. Each field
                        is numbered, correlating to 1 of 8 Object Modes that the object uses (See
                        Overview section, or ObjMode.txt).</p>
                    <p><b>BlocksLight0 (to BlocksLight7) -</b> Boolean Field. If equals 1, then the object will draw
                        a
                        shadow. If equals 0, then the object will not draw a shadow. Each field is
                        numbered, correlating to 1 of 8 Object Modes that the object uses (See Overview
                        section, or ObjMode.txt).</p>
                    <p><b>HasCollision0 (to HasCollision7) -</b> Boolean Field. If equals 1, then the object will
                        have
                        collision. If equals 0, then the object will not have collision, and units can
                        walk through it. Each field is numbered, correlating to 1 of 8 Object Modes
                        that the object uses (See Overview section, or ObjMode.txt).</p>
                    <p><b>IsAttackable0 -</b> Boolean Field. If equals 1, then the player can target this
                        object to be attacked, and the player will use the Kick skill when operating
                        the object. If the object has the Class equal to "CompellingOrb" or
                        "SoulStoneForge", then instead of using the Kick skill, players will use the
                        Attack skill when operating the object. If equals 0, then ignore this, and the
                        player will not use a skill or animation when operating the object.</p>
                    <p><b>Start0 (to Start7) -</b> Controls the frame for where the object will start playing
                        the next animation. Each field is numbered, correlating to 1 of 8 Object Modes
                        that the object uses (See Overview section, or ObjMode.txt).</p>
                    <p><b>EnvEffect -</b> Boolean Field. If equals 1, then enable the object to
                        update its mode based on the game's time of day. This can mean that when the
                        object is spawned, and it is current day time and the object is in Opened or
                        Operating mode, then it will reset back to Neutral mode. Also, if the current
                        time is dusk, night, or dawn and the object is in Neutral mode, then it will
                        change to Operating mode. If equals 0, then the object will not update its mode
                        based on the time of day.</p>
                    <p><b>IsDoor -</b> Boolean Field. If equals 1, then the object will be treated
                        as a door when the game handles its collision, animation properties, tooltips,
                        and commands. If equals 0, then ignore this.</p>
                    <p><b>BlocksVis -</b> Boolean Field. If equals 1, then the object will block the
                        player's line of sight to see anything beyond the object. If equals 0, then
                        ignore this. This field relies on the "IsDoor" field being enabled.</p>

                    <p><b>Orientation -</b> Determines the object's
                        orientation type, which can affect mouse selection priority of the object when
                        a unit is being rendered in front of or behind the object (such as a door
                        object covering a unit and how the mouse selection should handle that). This
                        also affects the randomization of the coordinates when spawning the object near
                        the edge of a room.</p>

                        which means the client and server will have synced animations. If equals 0,
                        then the animation rate will have random visual variation.</p>
                    <p><b>Damage -</b> Controls the amount of damage dealt by the object when it
                        performs an Operate Function ("OperateFn") that deals damage such as triggering
                        a pulse trap or an explosion.</p>

                        monstats2.txt (Example: If the "OverlayHeight" value is 4, then use the
                        "Height4" field). If the "OverlayHeight" value is 0, then ignore these "Height"
                        fields and add a default value of 75 to "Yoffset". Player unit types will
                        always use "Height2".</p>

                        of periodic frames to wait until redrawing the Overlay. This only works with
                        Overlays that are a loop type.</p>

                    <p><b>Trans -</b> Controls
                        the alpha mode for how the Overlay is displayed, which can affect transparency
                        and blending</p>

                        8 bits. This field acts as a bitwise shift value, which means it will modify
                        the mana value by the power of 2. For example, if this value equals 5 then that
                        means divide the mana value of 256ths by 2^5 = 32 (or multiply the mana by
                        32/256). A value equal to 8 means 256/256 which means that the mana of 256ths
                        value is not shifted.</p>

                        periodically (using the "perdelay" field), based on the if the "aurastate"
                        state is active. Aura skills will also override a preexisting state if that

                        as a passive, which can mean that the skill will not show up in the skill
                        selection menu and will not run a server do function. If equals 0, then the

                        This is only used for certain skill functions and will generally require the
                        usage of the "progcalc#" fields and the "aurastat#" fields. If equals 0, then

                    <p><b>scroll -</b> Boolean Field. If equals 1, then the skill can appear as a
                        scroll version in the skill selection UI, if the skill allows for the scroll
                        mechanics and if the player has the skill's scroll item in the inventory. If
                        equals 0, then ignore this.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b>calc1 (to calc6) -</b> Calculation Field. It is used as a possible parameter for
                        skill functions or as a numeric input for other calculation fields.</p>
                    <p><b>Param1 (to Param12) -</b> Integer Field. It is used as a possible parameter for skill
                        functions or as a numeric input for other calculation fields.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b>InGame -</b> Boolean Field. If equals 1, then the skill is enabled to
                        be used in-game. If equals 0, then the skill will be disabled in-game.</p>
                    <p><b>ToHit -</b> Baseline bonus Attack Rating that is added to the attack
                        when using this skill at level 1</p>
                    <p><b>LevToHit -</b> Additional bonus Attack Rating when using this skill,
                        calculated per skill level</p>
                    <p><b>ToHitCalc -</b> Calculation Field. Calculates the bonus Attack Rating when
                        using the skill. This will override the "ToHit" and "LevToHit" fields if it is
                        not blank.</p>

                    <p><b>ResultFlags -</b> Controls different flags that
                        can affect how the target reacts after being hit by the skill attack. Uses an
                        integer value to check against different bit fields by using the "&"
                        operator. For example, if the value equals 5 (binary = 101) then that returns
                        true for both the 4 (binary = 100) and 1 (binary = 1) bit field values.</p>

                    <p><b>HitClass -</b> Defines the skill's damage routines when hitting, mainly used for
                        determining hit sound effects and overlays. Uses
                        an integer value to check against different bit fields by using the "&"
                        operator. For example, if the value equals 6 (binary = 110) then that returns
                        true for both the 4 (binary = 100) and 2 (binary = 10) bit field values. There
                        are binary masks to check between Base Hit Classes and Hit Class Layers, which
                        can distinguish bewteen overlays or sounds are displayed.</p>

                    <p><b>Sound -</b> Defines the unique name ID
                        for the sound, which is how other files can reference the sound</p>

                    <br>

                    <p><b>Redirect
                            -</b> Points the
                        sound so the index of another sound in the data file. If this field is not
                        empty, the game will use the redirected sound instead of this sound. This can
                        be used when playing the game in the new graphics mode.</p>
                    <p><b>Channel
                            -</b> Declares which
                        channel the sound is initialized in. This can affect how different volume or
                        sound settings handle this sound. </p>
                    <p><b>FileName

                    <br>

                    <p><b>IsLocal
                            -</b> Boolean
                        Field. If equals 1, then this sound is considered a localized sound and will
                        change based on the game's localization setting. If equals 0, then ignore this.</p>
                    <p><b>IsMusic
                            -</b> Boolean
                        Field. If equals 1, then the sound is flagged as a music sound, which affects
                        how music related settings handle this sound. If equals 0, then ignore this.</p>
                    <p><b>IsAmbientScene
                            -</b> Boolean
                        Field. If equals 1, then the sound is flagged as an ambient scene sound, which
                        affects how the game handles the sound when the player transitions between
                        areas. If equals 0, then ignore this.</p>
                    <p><b>IsAmbientEvent
                            -</b> Boolean
                        Field. If equals 1, then the sound is flagged as an ambient event sound, which
                        affects how the game treats the sound when the player transitions between
                        areas. If equals 0, then ignore this.</p>
                    <p><b>IsUI
                            -</b> Boolean
                        Field. If equals 1, then the sound is flagged as a UI sound, which affects how
                        UI related settings handle this sound. If equals 0, then ignore this.</p>

                    <br>

                    <p><b>Volume
                            Min -</b> Controls
                        the minimum volume of the sound. Uses a range of 0 to 255.</p>
                    <p><b>Volume
                            Max -</b> Controls
                        the maximum volume of the sound. If both "Volume Min" and "Volume Max" fields
                        differ in value, then the sound will randomly select a volume value in between
                        these values when it is played. Uses a range of 0 to 255.</p>

                    <br>

                    <p><b>Pitch
                            Min -</b>
                        Controls the minimum pitch percentage of the sound.</p>
                    <p><b>Pitch
                            Max -</b> Controls
                        the maximum pitch percentage of the sound. If both "Pitch Min" and "Pitch Max"
                        fields differ in value, then the sound will randomly select a pitch value in
                        between these values when it is played.</p>

                    <br>

                    <p><b>Group
                            Size -</b> Defines
                        a sound Group by declaring a size value. When the sound has this value greater
                        than 0, then this sound is declared as the group's base sound. Any link to use
                        a sound should use the base sound, to signify that the game should use this
                        group of sounds. This field's value controls the number of sounds indexed after
                        base sound that should be added to the group. For example, if the sound has a
                        "Group Size" value equal to 5, then this sound is declared as the group's base
                        sound, and the next 4 sounds indexed after this base sound will be added to the
                        group.</p>
                    <p><b>Group
                            Weight -</b> Controls
                        the chance to pick the sound when it is part of a group with other sounds. If
                        all sounds in the group do not have a "Group Weight" value, then the group
                        sounds will play in historical order. This value controls a weighted random
                        chance, meaning that all related sounds have their weights added together for a
                        total chance and each sound's weight value is rolled against that total value
                        to determine if the sound is successfully picked. The higher this value, the
                        more likely the sound will be picked. This is only used when the sound is part
                        of a group (See "Group Size").</p>

                    <p><b>Loop
                            -</b> Boolean
                        Field. If equals 1, then the sound will replay itself after it finishes
                        playing. If equals 0, then the sound will only play once.</p>
                    <p><b>Fade
                            In -</b> Controls
                        how long to gradually increase the sound's volume starting from 0 when the
                        sound starts playing. Measured in audio game ticks, where 1 game frame is 40
                        audio ticks, and the game runs at 25 frames per second.</p>
                    <p><b>Fade
                            Out -</b>
                        Controls how long to gradually decrease the sound's volume to 0 when the sound
                        stops playing. Measured in audio game ticks, where 1 game frame is 40 audio
                        ticks, and the game runs at 25 frames per second.</p>

                            Inst -</b>

                        file defines the different states used by the game and controls how they
                        function. States are basically passive behaviors applied to units that can
                        apply various effects.</p>

                        game has a 50% chance to randomly use Unique Appellation when generating the

                        • If a Unique Appellation is not added, then the
                        game will generate a unique monster name using the string called Monster1Format
                        (ID: 1721)<br>
                        • If a Unique Appellation is added, then the game

                        then this item cannot be dropped.</p>

                        Field. If equals 1, then this item can only be created and dropped in online

                        This value acts as a numerator and a denominator. Each "rarity" value gets
                        summed together to give a total denominator, used for the random roll for the
                        item. For example, if there are 3 possible Unique items, and their "rarity"
                        values are 3, 5, 7, then their chances to be chosen are 3/15, 5/15, and 7/15
                        respectively. (The minimum "rarity" value equals 1) (Only works for games in

                        the item level being less than or equal to the area level. This value is also
                        affected by the relative Act number that the item is dropping in, where the
                        higher the Act number, then the more common the item will drop.</p>

                        not greater than the monster's level or the area level.</p>
                    <p><b>ShowLevel -</b> Boolean Field. If equals 1, then display the item level
                        next to the item name. If equals 0, then ignore this.</p>

                        the "quest" field is enabled, then the game will check the current difficulty
                        setting and will tie that difficulty setting to the quest item. This means that
                        the player can have more than 1 of the same quest item as long each they are
                        obtained per difficulty mode (Normal / Nightmare / Hell). If equals 0 and the
                        "quest" field is enabled, then the player can only have 1 count of the quest
                        item in the inventory, regardless of difficulty.</p>

                    <p><b>durwarning -</b> Controls the threshold value for durability to display the
                        low durability warning UI. This is only used if the item has durability.</p>
                    <p><b>qntwarning -</b> Controls the threshold value for quantity to display the
                        low quantity warning UI. This is only used if the item has stacks.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p><b>StrBonus -</b> The percentage multiplier that gets multiplied the player's
                        current Strength attribute value to modify the bonus damage percent from the
                        equipped item. If this equals 1, then default the value to 100.</p>
                    <p><b>DexBonus -</b> The percentage multiplier that gets multiplied the player's
                        current Dexterity attribute value to modify the bonus damage percent from the
                        equipped item. If this equals 1, then default the value to 100.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b>gemoffset -</b> Determines the starting index offset for reading the
                        gems.txt file when determining what effects gems or runes will have the item
                        based on the "gemapplytype" field. For example, if this value equals 9, then
                        the game will start with index 9 ("Chipped Emerald") and ignore the previously
                        defined gems in the gems.txt file, which can mean that those ignored gems will
                        not apply modifiers when socketed into the item.</p>
                    <p><b>bitfield1 -</b> Controls different flags that can affect the item. Uses an
                        integer value to check against different bit fields by using the "&"
                        operator. For example, if the value equals 5 (binary = 101) then that returns
                        true for both the 4 (binary = 100) and 1 (binary = 1) bit field values.</p>
